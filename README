If you test this CMS on other browsers, or on different browsers versions, please contact me.

One important thing is that if you want to put this CMS in another directory on the
site and not in the base directory, you MUST edit the scripts/shell.js file and
modify the vars MAINXML and FUNCTIONSXML to the path on the server in which the two
xmls are located. For example, on Altervista, to use PHP5, you have to put your
site into a directory called php5, so, if you want to use this site, you must edit
scripts/shell.js and change the two vars from "config/main.xml" and
"config/functions.xml" to "php5/config/main.xml" and "php5/config/functions.xml".
